In his infancy, he was well-loved and doted on by his mother, but it appeared as if his father had little to no parental emotions towards the boy due to Vegeta never wanting to have children and viewing hybrids as a disgrace. However, after the end of the Cell Games, the relationship between his parents improved and they got married, and they began raising Trunks as a family.",
